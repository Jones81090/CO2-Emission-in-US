# CO2 Emission in US Analysis


## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze carbon dioxide emissions data to understand trends over time, identify significant changes in emissions by sector and fuel type, and the environmental impact across different states and sectors in the United States. This analysis will provide valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and help inform policy decisions and environmental strategies.

## Data Source
This dataset contains carbon dioxide emissions data for various U.S. states from 1970 onwards. The data is broken down by state, sector (residential, commercial, transportation, electric power, and industrial), and fuel type (coal, petroleum, natural gas, and all fuels combined). The emissions values are measured in million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- WHAT IS THE OVERALL TREND IN CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS OVER THE YEARS ACROSS ALL STATES?
- ARE THERE ANY SECTORS THAT HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE/DECREASE IN EMISSIONS?
- WHICH FUEL TYPES CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS?
- HAVE THERE BEEN ANY SHIFTS IN THE USAGE OF DIFFERENT FUEL TYPES OVER THE YEARS?
- CALCULATE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FOR EACH STATE?
- DETERMINE THE YEAR WITH THE HIGHEST EMISSION FOR EACH STATE AND SECTOR
- DETERMINE THE SECTOR CONTRIBUTING THE MOST TO EMISSIONS FOR EACH STATE OVER THE ENTIRE TIME PERIOD
- IDENTIFY STATES WHERE EMISSIONS HAVE CONSISTENTLY DECREASED OVER THE PAST DECADE OR PAST 5 YEARS.
